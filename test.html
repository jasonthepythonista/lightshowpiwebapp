<!-- This html template is a test file for the web app that I am building for my lightshowpi -->
<!-- The main idea of this app is to have ajax send a command to raspberry pi server being run
     by Flask. When the running script then recieves that command, it executes a command to the
     command line of the pi. -->
<!-- Will style this html document by using W3.css as I like the simplicity of it -->
<!-- Device will need an all time internet connection to use w3.css)
